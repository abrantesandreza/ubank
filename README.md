## ubank - Personal Finance Management System

## Overview

This is a web-based application for managing personal finances. The system allows the user to create, read, update and delete transactions and categories, enabling them to keep track of their expenses and incomes. The application was developed using C#, ASP.NET Core MVC and SQL Server.

## Features

- Categories: the user can add, list, edit and delete categories, grouping transactions by purpose or nature, such as "Food", "Transportation", "Health", "Leisure", "Salary", "Investments", among others.

## Future Implementations

- Transactions: the user can add, list, edit and delete transactions, specifying the date, amount, description, and category.
- User authentication and authorization: the user would have to create an account and login to access the system.
- Charts and reports: the application could generate charts and reports to visualize the user's expenses and incomes by category or time period.
- Budget management: the user could set a budget for each category and receive alerts when they exceed the limit.
- Multiple accounts: the user could manage multiple bank accounts and credit cards, and reconcile their transactions with their bank statements.
